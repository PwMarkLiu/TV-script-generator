# TV-script-generator
This project is a part of Udacity's Deep learning course: Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN)
The purpose of this project for the student(me) to be able to implement Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) by themselves. We will be training the model on (Seinfeld TV scripts)[https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv] and generate a new script from it. One of the passing criteria is to train until the training loss falls below 3.5.

## Files included
* dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb - this will be the main file
* helper.py - it contains helper function, such as save function
* problem_unittests.py - this was used by the project reviewer as criteria to check the project.
* workspace_utils.py - this file is used to keep Udacity's workspace awake while training.

## Installation
1. Install `miniconda` on your system (here)[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html]
